# Safeguard AutoIt Resources

AutoIt user-defined functions (UDF) and samples for use with Safeguard for Privileged Passwords (SPP)

The Safeguard.au3 script contains an AutoIt UDF for connecting to SPP and calling the SPP API.
Authentication can be performed interactively or programmatically depending on the desired use
case. Several convenience functions are provided for easily retrieving credentials and interacting
with approval workflow. Safeguard A2A is also supported for scripting automated tasks.

This repository also contains samples that use this UDF to retrieve passwords from SPP and
automatically play them into client applications to improve user experience and automate routine
tasks.
